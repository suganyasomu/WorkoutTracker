# Unit 17 Nosql Homework: Workout Tracker

## Description
This is an application used to create a workout tracker. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve  data from MongoDb.

## Process
I started out by creating a server first, and then i handled  the apiroutes to GET ,POST and DELETE using express and then the htmlRoutes to send the html file. 

The user will be able to:

  * Add exercises to a previous workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises on the `stats` page.
